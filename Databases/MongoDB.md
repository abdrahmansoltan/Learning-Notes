### Notes for interview

- Interviewer : What is MongoDB?

- Me : it is a JSON database.

- Interviewer : Thanks(Rejected).

- Never do the same mistake I did!.

- Now, What exactly MongoDB is?
  It stores the data in BSON,
  So it's a BSON database.

- But, what exactly is BSON ðŸ¤”?
  Its simply Binary JSON.

- And, why exactly we use BSON instead of JSON?

  - In JSON, the text parsing is very slow

  - JSON file format is not space efficient.

  - JSON supports a limited number of basic data types.
