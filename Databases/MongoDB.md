## MongoDB

It's a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need

- It's best used for `unstructured data` of where the structure will change often

---

### MongoDB Features

- **Document-based database:** stores data in documents (field-value pair data structure **NoSQL**)
- **Scalable:** It has built-in scalability, which makes it very easy to distribute data across multiple machines as your users and amount of data grows
- **Flexible:** No document data schema required, So each document can have **different number and type of fields**, and they can be changed at anytime
- **Performant:** It's very performant thanks to features like:
  - Embedded data models
  - indexing
  - sharding
  - flexible document
  - native duplication
- **Free and open-source database**

---

### MongoDB Structure

![MongoDB Structure](./img/mongo-1.png)

- Here, each database can contain one or more **collections**
  - > which is equivalent to **tables** in SQL
- Each collection can contain one or more data structures called **"documents"** which contains data for one single entity

  - > which is equivalent to **rows** in SQL

- MongoDB uses a data format similar to JSON for data-storage called: **"BSON"**, which looks the same as JSON, but typed

- Document Structure (BSON)

  ![MongoDB Structure](./img/mongo-2.png)

  - So MongoDB documents are typed
  - `BSON` documents have fields(keys) which are equivalent to columns in relational database
    - It has some features that are not in (columns in relational DB), like that one `field` can have multiple values
  - MongoDB can have **Embedded documents** which is not available in relational databases
    - It's documents inside of documents by including related data into a single document
    - This allows for quicker access and easier data models which allows us to read all the data at once (it's not always the best solution though)
      - the equivalent of this in relational-DB is **Normalizing and Joining tables**

---

## MongoDB Services

### local DB

- **virtual properties:** are fields that we can define on our schema but will not be persisted (saved into the DB) in order to save space
  - They are useful for fields that can be derived from one another (ex: conversion miles to kilometers)
  - we cant use them in a query, as they aren't part of the DB

### Atlas

### MongoDB Atlas

- Each **cluster** is like an instance to the database

---

## MongoDB CRUD Operations

- delete:

  - It's a good practice not to send back to client a response message/data after delete request --> `null

    ```js
    res.status(204).json({
      status: 'success',
      data: null
    });
    ```

---

## MongoDB Middlewares (Hooks)

There's 4 types of middlewares in mongo: [`document`, `query`, `aggregate`, `model`]

- on each middleware-type, the `this` keyword point to the corresponding object
- we can do operations on data **before or after** it's saved in the DB
  - before -> `.pre`
    - this happens between receiving the data and persisting it to the database
  - after -> `.post`

---

## Aggregation Pipeline

- `$match` is for querying

---

## Mongoose

It's an **Object-Data-Modeling (ODM)** library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a higher level of abstraction.

- it's just a way for us to write javascript code that will interact with a database
- It's like a the relationship between Express and Node
  - Express -> is a layer of abstraction over regular Node
  - Mongoose -> is a layer of abstraction over the regular MongoDB driver

> We could just use a regular MongoDB-driver to access our database, and it would work, but instead we use `Mongoose` because it gives us a lot more functionality out of the box allowing for faster and simpler development

- **Features:**

  - Schemas to model data and relationships
  - Easy data validation
  - Simple query API
  - Middleware

- **Mongoose Schema:** is where we model our data, by describing the (structure of the data, default values and validation)
  - it's like **Classes** in JS
  - if added a document with fields that doesn't exist in the schema, the additional fields will be ignored
- **Mongoose Model:** is a wrapper for the schema providing an interface to the database for CRUD operation

### Connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose

[mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

![mongoose](./img/mongoose.PNG)

```js
await mongoose.connect(MONGO_URL);
```

---

### Creating Collections and Documents with Mongoose

1. First, we create a schema for a collection

   - for each field, we add the type or options-object

   ```js
   const tourSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: [true, 'A tour must have a name'],
       unique: true
     },
     rating: {
       type: Number,
       default: 4.5
     },
     price: {
       type: Number,
       required: [true, 'A tour must have a price']
     }
   });
   ```

2. We create a model with the schema for a document in the collection

   ```js
   const Tour = mongoose.model('Tour', tourSchema);

   // creating a document with the model (creating an instance)
   const testTour = new Tour({
     name: 'The Park Camper',
     price: 222,
     rating: 4.9
   });
   ```

3. save the document

   - if the collection wasn't in the DB, MongoDB will create one

   ```js
   testTour
     .save()
     .then(doc => {
       console.log(doc);
     })
     .catch(err => {
       console.log('ERROR xxx', err);
     }); // save document to DB

   // or
   Tour({
     name: 'The Park Camper',
     price: 222,
     rating: 4.9
   });
   ```

---

### Mongoose Modelling

- when using image field in the schema, we save it as a string, as it's recommended to save images in the DB as their names and then use the `fileSys` to get the actual images using that name
- we can also use custom validators for the fields in a model-collection using [validator library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

---

### Mongoose Query

We can filter by the native `.filter()` query method from MongoDB, or instead we can use the query methods from Mongoose

- when chaining queries, we should finish all querying, then `await` the result
  - first we build the query
  - then we execute the query
- when using filters like `gte`, we need to make it start with the `$` operator so that MongoDB can recognize it, we do this by adding `$` to the request-query items keys

  ```js
  let queryStr = JSON.stringify(queryObj);
  queryStr = queryStr.replace(/\b(gte|gt|lte|lt)\b/g, match => `$${match}`); // find on of these 4 words using regular expression and add "$" to it
  const query = Tour.find(JSON.parse(queryStr));
  ```

---

#### Aliasing (Manually adding query params)

Aliasing is when you have a route that do something, instead of writing the normal route with the req-params manually. This is done using a **middleware** before the route-controller

```js
// Middlewares
exports.aliasTopTours = (req, res, next) => {
  req.query.limit = '5';
  req.query.sort = '-ratingsAverage,price';
  req.query.fields = 'name,price,ratingsAverage,summary,difficulty';
  next();
};

// route
router.route('/top-5-cheap').get(tourController.aliasTopTours, tourController.getAllTours);
```

## Notes for interview

- Interviewer : What is MongoDB?

- Me : it is a JSON database.

- Interviewer : Thanks(Rejected).

- Never do the same mistake I did!.

- Now, What exactly MongoDB is?
  It stores the data in BSON,
  So it's a BSON database.

- But, what exactly is BSON ðŸ¤”?
  Its simply Binary JSON.

- And, why exactly we use BSON instead of JSON?

  - In JSON, the text parsing is very slow

  - JSON file format is not space efficient.

  - JSON supports a limited number of basic data types.
