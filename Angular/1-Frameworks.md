## Frameworks

`JavaScript frameworks` are tried and tested tools for building scalable web applications. They contain a collection of JavaScript code libraries that provide pre-written JS code for standard programming features and tasks.

- A JavaScript framework guides developers on building complex applications faster and more efficiently by providing an ecosystem of tools that improves the developer experience. Frameworks enable you to add functionalities like testing and linting to ensure you're shipping error-free code.

## Types of Frameworks

### Configuration-over-convention

- easy to use
- freedom to structure however you please
- needs additional libraries to fill in missing features
- EX: `React`, `Vue`

---

### convention-over-configuration

- structure straight out of the box
- Provides solutions for common problems
- larger learning curve
- EX: `Angular`

---

## Libraries vs Frameworks

- A `JavaScript library` refers to packaged code, methods, and functions that can be reused and repurposed. On the other hand,
- A `JavaScript framework` defines the application design, **can call on a library, and use code within it**. It doesn't offer a single solution; instead, it gives you a set of blueprints for building web applications.

### React

- `React` is not technically a framework; it's a library for UI components, but it's seen colloquially as a framework
- React.js provides fast UIs for interactive apps which use data efficiently by instantly applying changes to elements rather than updating all occurrences at once as other libraries do. It also supports incremental use with the virtual DOM (document object model) to make fast updates to web page content. React also uses JSX, a domain-specific interface created by the same team.

### Angular

- Angular is a `component-based framework`.
  - It offers developers a collection of integrated libraries and tools to develop, test, and update their code. This makes it a robust option for building and deploying web applications.
- Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, solid end-to-end tooling, and an integrated set of best practices to solve development challenges.
