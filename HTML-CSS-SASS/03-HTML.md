## Static vs Dynamic websites

| Static                 | Dynamic                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| files are already done | files need to be generated by an application running on the server |

## HTML

- **HyperText** is a form of text in which documents can refer(link) to other documents and resources
- **void(empty) element** is html element with no contents and no closing tag
- **Head element** is for things that are not visible in the browser window or things that descripe the document
- **Body element** is for things that are visible in the browser window
- **DOCTYPE** let the browser know that we are using html in this file, without it the browser will go to `Quirks mode`
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` is as the letters we use in the English language
- **Attribute** is a piece of data used to descripe elements
- **href** : HyperText Reference
- **HTML Entity** is symbols that start with `&` ex: _copyright_[&copy;], _non-breaking space_[&nbsp;]
  - find more here: [html entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp)

## semantic HTML

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

- used for search engine optimization(understanding structure of content)
- also for accessability (screen reader)
- Semantic elements = elements with a meaning
  - Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.
  - Examples of semantic elements: `<form>, <table>`, and `<article>`

---

## some inline elements to be aware of:

> inline elements in HTML aren't effected by [width/height] properties

- `<mark>`
- `<br>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`
- `<span>`

---

## tricks

- to make link go to other tab and not the current one, use the **target** attribute : `target="_blank"`
- to check if your HTML syntax is right => [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
- `&nbsp;` will add more whiteSpace to a line but won't break it.
- use `<span>` to isolate part of a paragraph
- to link label to input form => use `id='nameofID'` in the `<input>` element,`for='nameofID'` in the `<label>` element
- in `<input>`
  - **radio** => for only one option
  - **checkbox** => for one/more options
- in FORM when choosing option or inserting input field => what is sent is what in the **value** attribute

---

## Architecturing files

- **BEM** (Block - Element - Modifier)
  ![bem](./img/bem.jpg)

- also you can use `helper class` which is used when you have an item that is used many times but in one place of its use we want to add a css-propery to it 'like margin-right-small'

  ```html
  <a href="#" class="btn btn--full margin-right-sm">click here!</a>
  ```

  ```css
  /* HELPER/SETTINGS CLASSES */

  .margin-right-sm {
    margin-right: 1.6rem !important;
  }

  .margin-bottom-md {
    margin-bottom: 4.8rem !important;
  }

  .center-text {
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

---

## Form

- you can use [netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/?_ga=2.17094910.693790722.1649686633-761975974.1648039605) to manage your forms without `Js` => by inserting `name` attribute to each `input` element and writing this at at the `form` element:
  ```html
  <form class="cta-form" name="sign-up" netlify></form>
  ```

---

## Accessibility & Performance

[LightHouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) => but note that you should do it when it's deployed on a real server and not offline in your pc (local server)

- use `meta` tags
- use `descriptive`

---

### images

#### `fav-icon`

[website for doing all this](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)

- use `fav-icon` for **Browsers** and make sure to resize it to **64px**
- for `apple` --> use resized favicon

- for `android` :

  - create `manifest.webmanifest` file which contains this code :

  ```webmanifest
  {
    "icons": [
      { "src": "img/favicon-192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192" },
      { "src": "img/favicon-512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - also add this to `html` `<head>`

    ```html
    <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest" />
    ```

---

#### background img in css

- when you use **background img** in css and want it to be `Accessible` in `HTML` to write `alt` for screen readers

  - `role` describes the role of an element in programs that can make use of it, such as screen readers or magnifiers.

  - `aria-label` attribute defines a string value that labels an interactive element.
  - in `HTML` :

    ```html
    <div class="cta-img-box" role="img" aria-label="Womanenjoying food"></div>
    ```

  - in `CSS` :
    ```css
    .cta-img-box {
      background-image: url("../img/eating.jpg");
      background-size: cover;
    }
    ```

---

#### image size optimization

- to reduce size of images => [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) and use the `webp` format

  - but check `compatibility` with browsers **or** use it with `fallback img` and let the browsers choose by itself.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="img/hero.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="img/hero-min.png" type="image/png" />

  <!-- browser will choose which src it can display and displays it in the <img> element below -->

  <img
    src="img/hero-min.png"
    class="hero-img"
    alt="Woman enjoying food, meals in storage container, and food bowls on a table"
  />
</picture>
```

---

## DOM (document object model)

Here the **Tree structure** is the operation that make html code looks the way it does on the browser(rendered)

```

```
