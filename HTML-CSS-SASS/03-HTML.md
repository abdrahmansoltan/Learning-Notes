## Static vs Dynamic websites

| Static                 | Dynamic                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| files are already done | files need to be generated by an application running on the server |

## HTML

- **HyperText** is a form of text in which documents can refer(link) to other documents and resources
- **void(empty) element** is html element with no contents and no closing tag
- **Head element** is for things that are not visible in the browser window or things that descripe the document
- **Body element** is for things that are visible in the browser window
- **DOCTYPE** let the browser know that we are using html in this file, without it the browser will go to `Quirks mode`
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` is as the letters we use in the English language
- **Attribute** is a piece of data used to descripe elements
- **href** : HyperText Reference
- **HTML Entity** is symbols that start with `&` ex: _copyright_[&copy;], _non-breaking space_[&nbsp;]
  - find more here: [html entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp)

## semantic HTML

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

- used for search engine optimization(understanding structure of content)
- also for accessability (screen reader)
- Semantic elements = elements with a meaning
  - Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.
  - Examples of semantic elements: `<form>, <table>`, and `<article>`

---

## some inline elements to be aware of:

> inline elements in HTML aren't effected by [width/height] properties

- `<mark>`
- `<br>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`
- `<span>`

---

## tricks

- to make link go to other tab and not the current one, use the **target** attribute : `target="_blank"`
- to check if your HTML syntax is right => [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
- `&nbsp;` will add more whiteSpace to a line but won't break it.
- use `<span>` to isolate part of a paragraph
- to link label to input form => use `id='nameofID'` in the `<input>` element,`for='nameofID'` in the `<label>` element
- in `<input>`
  - **radio** => for only one option
  - **checkbox** => for one/more options
- in FORM when choosing option or inserting input field => what is sent is what in the **value** attribute

## Architecturing files

- **BEM** (Block - Element - Modifier)
  ![bem](./img/bem.jpg)

- also you can use `helper class` which is used when you have an item that is used many times but in one place of its use we want to add a css-propery to it 'like margin-right-small'

  ```html
  <a href="#" class="btn btn--full margin-right-sm">click here!</a>
  ```

  ```css
  /* HELPER/SETTINGS CLASSES */

  .margin-right-sm {
    margin-right: 1.6rem !important;
  }

  .margin-bottom-md {
    margin-bottom: 4.8rem !important;
  }

  .center-text {
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

---

## Form

- you can use [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage your forms without `Js` => by inserting `name` attribute to each `input` element and writing this at at the `form` element:
  ```html
  <form class="cta-form" name="sign-up" netlify></form>
  ```

---

## Accessibility

[LightHouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) => but note that you should do it when it's deployed on a real server and not offline in your pc (local server)

- use `meta` tags
- use `descriptive`
- `fav-icon` => [website for doing all this](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)

  - use `fav-icon` for **Browsers** and meke sure to resize it to **64px**
  - use `fav-icon` for **apple / android** devices and meke sure to resize it

- to reduce size of images => [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) and use the `webp` format, but check compatibility with browsers or use it with fallback img and let the browsers choose

  ```html
  <picture>
    <source srcset="img/hero.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <source srcset="img/hero-min.png" type="image/png" />

    <img
      src="img/hero-min.png"
      class="hero-img"
      alt="Woman enjoying food, meals in storage container, and food bowls on a table"
    />
  </picture>
  ```

## DOM (document object model)

Here the **Tree structure** is the operation that make html code looks the way it does on the browser(rendered)
