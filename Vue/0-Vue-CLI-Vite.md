## Development Experience

we use development-server for:

- saved changes should be auto-detected and page should reload/update automatically
- IDE should provide better auto-completion, snippets and hints
- we should be able to split code into multiple files and export/import via `ES-modules`

## Vue CLI

- it enable us to use files with `.vue` extension which has 3 sections (`HTML` + `script` + `style`)
  - This is called **"single file components"**
- it works using a **"Build Workflow"**
  - which takes our code and do a `Build Step` to change code to use standard Javascript code that works on the browser
