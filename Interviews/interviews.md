## Non Technical interviews

- stories to have from your experience:
  - Technical story
  - Success(promotion ladder) story
  - Leadership story (can go on his own and not needing someone to always guide him)
  - Challenge story (can figure out how to do or tackle any problem)

### Personality Questions

- Tell me about Yourself:

  - tell a "Hero story" about your journey from start to finish that has your (triggers of success)
  - mention things you want to get asked
  - mention skills that should be relevant to the job

- What is your biggest weakness?
  - real answer
  - show how you improved it
  - > EX: sometimes when I have a coding problem, I get straight into coding without really thinking about the problem, and as I'm typing I realized that perhaps I should have waited and planned out how my code should be structured, and what problem am I really solving before I start coding it.
    >
    > - so lately, I've taken the time to make sure that I write "pseudo code" first and commenting out my steps, inputs and assumptions before I actually jump in coding.

### Company Questions

- Why Join Us?

  - try to make the interviewer feel special by showing how you're interested in the company's work and how you love to work there
    - never show that you apply to the company blindly/randomly
    - show them that you've done your research about the company
  - show you want to grow (with them)
  - demonstrate why you are the best fit by **linking** your skills/experience and projects with the company's work

- Why did you leave your job?
  - the most important rule to remember is: **No Negativity**
    - don't complain about your co-workers, boss, codeBase that you worked with
  - be as **Positive** as possible by saying:
    - you want to **grow**
    - you want more challenge
    - you want to work with people that are really smart like they have at the company you're applying to

### Interviewer Questions

- Do you have any questions for me?
  - focus on the interviewer, not `company` or `yourself`
  - mention something they've mentioned (this shows that you're paying attention to what they're saying in the interview)
    - use the info they tell you about themselves at the beginning of the interview
  - > EX:
    >
    > - what is a big mistake that you did at the beginning of your jeb here? and what did you do?
    > - where you see the company going in the next 3 years, as I want to work here for a while and you have better knowledge of the company than I do, and I would like to see where the company is headed.
    > - Have you seen your skills grow here in the past 3 years?
    > - What you wish somebody told them when they just started the job at this company?

## Negotiation

- Offer negotiation
  - don't end the conversation with `yes/no`, and keep the conversation going
    - > EX: you can say this: "This sounds fantastic, I really thought this was a great fit when I met you and interviewed in the company, and I'm really glad to see that we both agree and you see a good fit here. Right now I'm talking to a few other companies, so I can't really speak to the full details of the offer until I'm done with the interviewing process and I'm closer to making a decision, but I'm sure that we can find something that works great for us because I would really love to be part of your team and I had a great time interviewing and I could really see myself working there long term."
  - ask for some time to think and (give a reason for everything)
    - > EX: instead of saying: "well, I need more time to think about it", you can say this: "well thank you very much for this offer, and I'm very excited to potentially working with your company, **However** this is a big family decision and I'm looking to work at a company for many years, So I'd like to discuss this with my wife/partner and have some time to make sure that there's something that we're both comfortable with."
  - Always negotiate
    - Find exact salary you want and **Go higher**, as probably they won't agree to your initial demand
    - > if you never asked, the answer is always no
  - Have stake
    - don't show disparateness by showing that you have multiple offers
- Having an offer

  - when you have an offer from a company, let other companies (you are negotiating with) know, and build a deadline
  - > EX: write this email to other companies: "Hello, I just want to let you know and give you an update on my interviewing process. I've just received an offer from another company(you can say its name) which is quite a strong offer, with that said I'm really excited to potentially be working with your company, as I had a really good time interviewing with you and I really wanted to see if we can make things work. since my timeline is now a little bit compressed with this new offer, is there anything we can do to make the process go a little bit faster?"

- Handling multiple offers

  - try to look at this priority list (top is most important) when choosing:
    1. is there an offer that you feel you're under-qualified for(hard job)?
       - note that taking this job will challenge you to be better the next time you interview
    2. Long term growth potential
    3. will you respect people around you? (environment)
    4. salary and benefits
    5. is your decision based on desperation?

- Getting a raise

  - Actually do "Ask" for a raise (they most likely won't until you ask for it)
  - show. Don't tell
    - show how much you're valuable
    - every 6 months, keep a folder with all the good things, comments or feedback you've done/gotten for the company, and perhaps keep track of your skill level from the first day on the job to the 6 months mark, showing what did you learn and improve on, so gather all that with a plan for you in the next 6 months to show to your employer
    - show your employer why you deserve a higher salary based on the previous note, showing that you're a different person than you were when they first hired you when they didn't know that you were going to be valuable
    - Ask for a salary-level that is a lot higher than you actually want, as they would find a middle ground that is happy for both parties
    - Remember, to value yourself, you've done a great job with the company, they want to keep you because they value you
