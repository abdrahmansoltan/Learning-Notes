- **Manifest** — It defines how the application is displayed to the user and how it gets launched. All metadata related to the app is also defined here — starting URL, full and short name, link icons, splash screen and so on.

- **Service Workers** — Service workers **enable offline work mode**, background syncs and push notifications. Caching and storage APIs available to service works allow pre-caching of content. As defined on Google developer, a service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don’t need a web page or user interaction.
