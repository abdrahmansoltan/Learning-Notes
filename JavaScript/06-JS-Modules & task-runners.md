## Notes

- As our program grows bigger, it may contain many lines of code. Instead of putting everything in a single file, you can use `modules` to separate codes in separate files as per their functionality. This makes our code organized and easier to maintain.
- `Module` is a file that contains code to perform a specific task. A module may contain variables, functions, classes etc.

---

## Module

> More on modules here -> [Modules & Bundlers](../DEV/Modules%20%26%20Bundlers.md)

A **module** is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

- Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

  - `export` keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
  - `import` allows the import of functionality from other modules.

- As modules support special keywords and features, we **must** tell the browser that a script should be treated as a module, by using the attribute `<script type="module">`.

  - The browser automatically fetches and evaluates the imported module (and its imports if needed), and then runs the script.

  ```html
  <script type="module" defer src="script.js"></script>
  ```

- Modules work only via **HTTP(s)**, not locally as it requires CORS access and other protocols
  - That's why we use a local web-server, such as ‚Äúlive server‚Äù and can't open it locally without a server

---

### Module Features

- Always **‚Äúuse strict‚Äù**
- Module-level scope

  - Each module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts.
  - This will cause error as each module has independent variables and we shouldn't depend on the order of the scripts

    ```js
    <!doctype html>
    <script type="module" src="user.js"></script> // let user = "John";
    <script type="module" src="hello.js"></script> // alert(user);
    ```

  - This will work fine:

    ```js
    <!doctype html>
    <script type="module" src="user.js"></script> // let user = "John";

    <script type="module" src="hello.js"></script> // it contains this:
    // import {user} from './user.js';
    // alert(user);
    ```

  - more explanation

    ```js
    // Here are two scripts on the same page, both type="module". They don‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs top-level variables:

    <script type="module">
      // The variable is only visible in this module script
      let user = "John";
    </script>

    <script type="module">
      alert(user); // Error: user is not defined
    </script>
    ```

- A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported

  - If the same module is imported into multiple other modules, its code is executed only once, upon the first `import`. Then its exports are given to all further `importers`.

    ```js
    // üìÅ alert.js
    alert("Module is evaluated!");

    // Import the same module from different files

    // üìÅ 1.js
    import `./alert.js`; // "Module is evaluated!"

    // üìÅ 2.js
    import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)
    ```

- In a module, **‚Äúthis‚Äù** is undefined

  - Compare it to non-module scripts, where this is a `global` object:

    ```html
    <script>
      alert(this); // window
    </script>

    <script type="module">
      alert(this); // undefined
    </script>
    ```

---

### Module scripts

- Module scripts are deferred

  - downloading external module scripts `<script type="module" src="...">` doesn‚Äôt block HTML processing, they load in parallel with other resources.
  - module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster than HTML), and then run.
  - relative order of scripts is maintained: scripts that go first in the document, execute first.

- **Async** works on inline scripts

  - For non-module scripts, the `async` attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document.
  - in this example, It performs the `import (fetches ./analytics.js)` and runs when ready, even if the HTML document is not finished yet, or if other scripts are still pending.

    ```html
    <!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->
    <!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->
    <script async type="module">
      import { counter } from './analytics.js';

      counter.count();
    </script>
    ```

- **External scripts:** External scripts that have type="module" are different in two aspects:

  1. External scripts with the same src run only once:

  ```html
  <!-- the script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->
  <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
  ```

  2. External scripts that are fetched from another origin (e.g. another site) require **CORS** headers

     - In other words, if a module script is fetched from another origin, the remote server must supply a header **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** allowing the fetch.
     - That ensures better security by default.

     ```html
     <!-- another-site.com must supply Access-Control-Allow-Origin -->
     <!-- otherwise, the script won't execute -->
     <script type="module" src="http://another-site.com/their.js"></script>
     ```

## Exporting & Importing code

Most programming languages provide a way to import code from one file into another. JavaScript wasn‚Äôt originally designed with this feature, because JavaScript was designed to only run in the browser, with no access to the file system of the client‚Äôs computer (for security reasons). So for the longest time, organizing JavaScript code in multiple files required you to load each file with variables shared globally.

In 2009, a project named CommonJS was started with the goal of specifying an ecosystem for JavaScript outside the browser. A big part of CommonJS was its specification for **modules**, which would finally allow JavaScript to import and export code across files like most programming languages, without resorting to global variables. The most well-known of implementation of CommonJS modules is **node.js**.

### Exporting

- The `export` statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export live bindings to functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the import statement.
- Exported modules are in `strict mode` whether you declare them as such or not.
- exports must happen in top-level code (global scope)

There are two types of exports

#### Named Exports (Zero or more exports per module)

- No semicolons after export class/function

  - note that `export` before a class or a function does not make it a function expression. It‚Äôs still a function declaration, albeit exported.
  - Most JavaScript style guides don‚Äôt recommend semicolons after function and class declarations.

```js
// Exporting individual features
export let name1, name2, ‚Ä¶, nameN; // also var, const
export let name1 = ‚Ä¶, name2 = ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶, nameN; // also var, const
export function functionName(){...}
export class ClassName {...}

// multiple exports with Renaming exports
const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;
export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

// Exporting destructured assignments with renaming
export const { name1, name2: bar } = obj;
```

#### Default Exports (One per module)

They're used with Modules that declare a single entity, e.g. a module `user.js` exports only `class User`.

- This approach is preferred, so that every ‚Äúthing‚Äù resides in its own module.
- Naturally, that requires a lot of files, as everything wants its own module, but that‚Äôs not a problem at all. Actually, code navigation becomes easier if files are well-named and structured into folders.
- There may be only one export default per file. And then `import` it without curly braces
- here we don't export `declaration` or `variables` but we export `values` or `(expressions that already return values)`

  ```javascript
  // üìÅ user.js
  export default class User {
    // just add "default"
    constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
  ```

- Technically, we may have both default and named exports in a single module, but in practice people usually don‚Äôt mix them. A module has either named exports or the default one.

  - Here‚Äôs how to import the default export along with a named one:

    ```js
    // üìÅ main.js
    import { default as User, sayHi } from './user.js';

    new User('John');
    ```

---

### Importing

[reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#dynamic_imports)

- At first sight, ‚Äúimport everything‚Äù `import * as say from ./say.js` seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?
  - Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: `sayHi()` instead of `say.sayHi()`.
  - Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier.
- Don‚Äôt be afraid to import too much
  - Modern build tools, such as **webpack** and others, bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup loading. They also removed unused imports.

1. for Named Exports

   - It's preferred for large libraries like `lodash` and `reactDom`
     - so you only import what you need from them
   - import needs curly braces for named exports

   ```javascript
   // creating a `name-space` from importing => to use in the file
   import * as myModule from 'module-name';
   // now "myModule" will act as an object which has properties & mehtods we can use
   myModule.moduleFunc();

   // Import a single export from a module
   // "export1" must be the same name in the module
   import { export1 } from 'module-name';
   import { export1 as alias1 } from 'module-name';

   // Import multiple exports from module
   import { export1, export2 } from 'module-name';
   ```

2. Import a module for its **side effects** only

   - This runs the module's global code, but doesn't actually import any values.
   - you can do this with importing **css files** into javascript files

   ```javascript
   import 'module-name';

   // example : This works with dynamic imports
   (async () => {
     if (somethingIsTrue) {
       // import module for side effects
       await import('/modules/my-module.js');
     }
   })();
   ```

3. Importing defaults

- team members may use different names to import the same thing, and that‚Äôs not good.

  - Usually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there‚Äôs a rule that imported variables should correspond to file names, e.g:

    ```js
    import User from './user.js';
    import LoginForm from './loginForm.js';
    ```

  - Still, some teams consider it a serious drawback of default exports. So they prefer to always use named exports. Even if only a single thing is exported, it‚Äôs still exported under a name, without default.

```javascript
// here we can name it whatever we want as it was exported without a name
import myDefault from '/modules/my-module.js';
```

1. Importing (defaults + named) exports

   ```javascript
   import add, { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';
   // here (add) is the default import
   ```

2. Dynamic Imports

   - The standard import syntax is static and will always result in all code in the imported module being evaluated at load time. In situations where you wish to load a module conditionally or on demand, you can use a dynamic import instead.

   - To dynamically import a module, the `import` keyword may be called as a `function`. When used this way, it returns a `promise`.

   ```javascript
   import('/modules/my-module.js').then(module => {
     // Do something with the module.
     module.loadPageInto(main);
   });

   // or using "await" keyword
   let module = await import('/modules/my-module.js');
   ```

- No ‚Äúbare‚Äù modules allowed

  - In the browser, `import` must get either a relative or absolute URL. Modules without any path are called **‚Äúbare‚Äù modules**. Such modules are not allowed in `import`.

    ```js
    import { sayHi } from 'sayHi'; // Error, "bare" module
    // the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is
    ```

---

### Re-exporting

‚ÄúRe-export‚Äù syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name), like this:

```js
export { sayHi } from './say.js'; // re-export sayHi

export { default as User } from './user.js'; // re-export default
```

- Why would that be needed?

  - Imagine, we‚Äôre writing a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù: a folder with a lot of modules, with some of the functionality exported outside, and many modules are just ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù, for internal use in other package modules.
  - We‚Äôd like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point.

    - In other words, a person who would like to use our package, should import only from the ‚Äúmain file‚Äù `auth/index.js`.

      ```js
      import { login, logout } from 'auth/index.js';
      //The ‚Äúmain file‚Äù, auth/index.js exports all the functionality that we‚Äôd like to provide in our package.
      ```

  - The idea is that outsiders, other programmers who use our package, should not meddle with its internal structure, search for files inside our package folder. We export only what‚Äôs necessary in auth/index.js and keep the rest hidden from prying eyes.

    ```js
    // üìÅ auth/index.js

    // import login/logout and immediately export them
    import { login, logout } from './helpers.js';
    export { login, logout };

    // import default as User and export it
    import User from './user.js';
    export { User };
    ```

  - The syntax `export ... from ...` is just a shorter notation for such `import`-`export`:

    ```js
    // üìÅ auth/index.js
    // re-export login/logout
    export { login, logout } from './helpers.js';

    // re-export the default export as User
    export { default as User } from './user.js';
    ```

#### Re-exporting the default export

The default export needs separate handling when re-exporting.

- We can come across two problems with it:

  1. `export User from './user.js'` won‚Äôt work. That would lead to a syntax error.

     - To re-export the default export, we have to write

       ```js
       export {default as User}
       ```

  2. `export * from './user.js'` re-exports only named exports, but ignores the default one.

  - If we‚Äôd like to re-export both named and default exports, then two statements are needed:

  ```js
  export * from './user.js'; // to re-export named exports
  export { default } from './user.js'; // to re-export the default export
  ```

> Such oddities of re-exporting a default export are one of the reasons why some developers don‚Äôt like default exports and prefer named ones.

---

## modular pattern

The module pattern is a special Design pattern in which we use IFFI (Immediately invoked function expression), and we return an object. Inside of that object, we can have functions as well as variables.

> note that the thing that make this possible (reaching what the IIFE-function returns after it was self-invoked) is => `closures`

- Private methods or functions are members of given entity than can be seen only within said entity. Public ones can be accessed from the outside of given entity.

  ```javascript
  // IIFE
  const Formatter = (function () {
    const log = message => console.log(`[${Date.now()}] Logger: ${message}`);
  })();

  // using it
  Formatter.log('Hello');
  ```

## Old vs Modern Javascript with Package managers

- in old javascript development when we wanted to include a library, we needed to download its `.js` file and include it before our main `.js` file in the `html` file
  - The good thing was that it was easy enough to understand. The bad thing was that it was annoying to find and download new versions of libraries every time they would update.
- Starting around 2010, several competing JavaScript package managers (`npm`, `yarn`, `Bower`) emerged to help automate the process of downloading and upgrading libraries from a central repository
  - Note that `npm` was originally a package manager made specifically for `node.js`, a JavaScript runtime designed to run on the **server**, not the frontend (in the browser).
  - Using package managers generally involves using a command line, which in the past was never required as a frontend dev

---

## Build Tools

In real-life, browser modules are rarely used in their ‚Äúraw‚Äù form. Usually, we bundle them together with a special tool such as Webpack and deploy to the production server.

- One of the benefits of using bundlers ‚Äì they give more control over how modules are resolved, allowing bare modules and much more, like CSS/HTML modules.

### Build Tools Steps

1. Take a ‚Äúmain‚Äù module, the one intended to be put in `<script type="module">` in HTML.
2. Analyze its dependencies: imports and then imports of imports etc.
3. Build a single file with all modules (or multiple files, that‚Äôs tunable), replacing native `import` calls with bundler functions, so that it works. ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù module types like HTML/CSS modules are also supported.
4. In the process, other transformations and optimizations may be applied:

   - Unreachable code removed.
   - Unused exports removed (‚Äútree-shaking‚Äù).
   - Development-specific statements like `console` and `debugger` removed.
   - Modern, bleeding-edge JavaScript syntax may be transformed to older one with similar functionality using **Babel**.
   - The resulting file is minified (spaces removed, variables replaced with shorter names, etc).

> If we use bundle tools, then as scripts are bundled together into a single file (or few files), import/export statements inside those scripts are replaced by special bundler functions. So the resulting ‚Äúbundled‚Äù script does not contain any import/export, it doesn‚Äôt require type="module", and we can put it into a regular script:
>
> ```html
> <!-- Assuming we got bundle.js from a tool like Webpack -->
> <script src="bundle.js"></script>
> ```

You can find more in depth here -> [Modules & Bundlers](../DEV/Modules%20%26%20Bundlers.md)

## Task runners

### NPM

- `npm init`
  - generate a new file named `package.json` This is a configuration file that npm uses to save all project information.
    - it can be described as a manifest of your project that includes the packages and applications it depends on, information about its unique source control, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author.
    - it is always structured in the JSON format, which allows it to be easily read as metadata and parsed by machines.
  - > You can use `npm init --yes` to Instantly Initialize a Project
- `npm install package-name`

  - This command does two things:
    1. first, it downloads all the code from the package into a folder called `node_modules`.
    2. Second, it automatically modifies the `package.json` file to keep track of the package as a project dependency.

> This is useful later when sharing a project with others‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinstead of sharing the `node_modules` folder (which can get very large), you only need to share the `package.json` file and other developers can install the required packages automatically with the command `npm install`

- now to use the library/package, we have 2 choices:

  1. **Use the `.js` file in the `node_modules/package_name` directory**

     - This means we can link to the npm downloaded version of the package in the `index.html` file as follows:

     ```html
     <script src="node_modules/package_name.js"></script>
     <script src="index.js"></script>
     ```

     - So the good thing is that we can now use npm to download and update our packages through the command line. The bad thing is right now we‚Äôre digging through the `node_modules` folder to find the location of each package and manually including it in our HTML. That‚Äôs pretty inconvenient

  2. **Using a JavaScript module bundler (webpack)**

     - using `node.js` modules. Instead of loading all of `package_name.js` with an HTML script tag, you can load it directly in the JavaScript file as follow:

       ```js
       // index.js
       var moment = require('moment');

       // rest of the main code
       ```

     - This is all great for `node.js`, but if we tried to use the above code in the browser, we get an error saying `require` is not defined. The browser doesn‚Äôt have access to the file system, which means loading modules in this way is very tricky‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääloading files has to be done dynamically, either synchronously (which slows down execution) or asynchronously (which can have timing issues).
     - This is where a module bundler comes in. **A JavaScript module bundler is a tool that gets around the problem with a build step (which has access to the file system) to create a final output that is browser compatible (which doesn‚Äôt need access to the file system)**.
       - In this case, we need a module bundler to find all require statements (which is invalid browser JavaScript syntax) and replace them with the actual contents of each required file. The final result is a single bundled JavaScript file (with no require statements)!
     - > The most popular module bundler was [Browserify](https://browserify.org/), Around 2015, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) eventually became the more widely used module bundler (fueled by the popularity of the **React** frontend framework, which took full advantage of webpack‚Äôs various features).
     - Now that we have webpack‚Äôs **dist/main.js** output, we are going to use it instead of `index.js` in the browser, as it contains invalid require statements. This would be reflected in the `index.html` file as follows:

       ```html
       <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
       ```

- Bundling with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- writing `scripts`

---

### npm scripts

It is a tool that automates different parts of the build process (Triggering Build Workflow). For frontend development, tasks include `minifying code`, `optimizing images`, `running tests`, etc.

- The `"scripts"` property of your `package.json` file supports a number of built-in scripts and their preset life cycle events as well as arbitrary scripts. These all can be executed by running `npm run-script <stage>` or `npm run <stage>` for short.
- Pre and post commands with matching names will be run for those as well (e.g. `premyscript`, `myscript`, `postmyscript`). Scripts from dependencies can be run with `npm explore <pkg> -- npm run <stage>`.

> In 2013, [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) was the most popular frontend task runner, with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (more about Gulp in [FrontEnd.md file](../Internet/FrontEnd.md)) following shortly after. Both rely on plugins that wrap other command line tools. Nowadays the most popular choice seems to be using the scripting capabilities built into the **npm package manager** itself, which doesn‚Äôt use plugins but instead works with other command line tools directly.

it's the `entries` in the `scripts` field of the `package.json` file. The scripts field holds an object where you can specify various commands and scripts that you want to expose.

>

>   - `cat` -> `catw`
>   - `mkdir` -> `mkdirp`
>   - `rm` -> `rimraf`
>   - `&` -> `npm-run-all -parallel`
>
> This is achievable because most packages come with shell commands

- This is very useful when we have repetitive tasks and we have to automate them.

- how it work -> there is a folder called `.bin`, in `node_modules`. this folder contains **binary-executables** for each installed module/package, which we can run using scripts

- [reference](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts)

- in `package.json` :

  ```json
  // you may have to remove the ("main" line) above "scripts" in the file or replace it with "default"
  {
    "default": "index.html",

    "scripts": {
      "start": "parcel index.html",
      "build": "parcel build index.html --dist-dir ./dist"
    }
  }
  ```

> Note that the scripts in `package.json` can run webpack without having to specify the full path `./node_modules/.bin/parcel`, since `node.js` knows the location of each npm module path
> ![npm-path](./img/npm-path.png)

- These can be executed using the following command :

  ```bash
  # npm run <script-name>

  npm run start
  # or
  npm start

  # run this after finishing development and removed (dist, modules) folders and you are ready for deployment
  npm run build
  ```

#### Pre & Post Scripts

To create "**pre**" or "**post**" scripts for any scripts defined in the "scripts" section of the `package.json`, simply create another script with a matching name and add "`pre`" or "`post`" to the beginning of them.

- They're also called **npm lifehooks commands**:

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "precompress": "{{ executes BEFORE the `compress` script }}",
      "compress": "{{ run command to compress files }}",
      "postcompress": "{{ executes AFTER `compress` script }}"
    }
  }
  ```

### Package manager Notes

- **devDependency**: this saves it as a development dependency, which means it‚Äôs a package that you need in your development environment but not on your production server
  - it's done with the `--save-dev` argument or `-D`
- When a package has a version starts with **`^`**, this means that we tell tha package manager to install **the latest version**
- `Bundling` with `parcel` creates a `script` not a `module`, so in html we shouldn't write `type="module"` in `<script>`
- if you're using `windows`, don't write scripts with **single quotation** as it won't work, so you'll have to use **double quotation**
