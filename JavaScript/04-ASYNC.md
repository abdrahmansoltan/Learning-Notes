## Notes

- if you are using hosted version of an Api => don't forget to put `defer` in the `<script>` part of it in the HTML `<head>`
- in `event loop` :
  - `callback functions` that are coming from **promises** go to **microTasks queue** not the `callback queue`.
  - **microTasks queue** has priority over **callback queue** in `event loop`

---

## Is JavaScript a `synchronous` or `asynchronous` ?

- JavaScript is always `synchronous` & `single-threaded`, and it has no Asynchronous ability
- **but** when `js` runs on certain environments like **browser** or **node.js** --> it allows us to write `asynchronous functionality` like `setTimeOut()` which is not from `javascript` but it's from `window / global` object
- so **Javascript has no timer**, as the timer-function is **Web-browser feature**

> **Async** means that "we don't have it right now"

---

## Building a Promise

- when you create a new promise you put an `execution function` which takes `2` callback functions `(resolve, reject)` as parameters
  - what is returned from `(resolve, reject)` functions will be the fulfilled / rejected value that we handle them using `.then() / .catch()`

### creating a promise

```javascript
// creating the promise
const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  console.log('Lotter draw is happening ðŸ”®');
  setTimeout(function () {
    if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
      resolve('You WIN ðŸ’°');
    } else {
      reject(new Error('You lost your money ðŸ’©'));
    }
  }, 2000);
});

// using the promise
lotteryPromise.then(res => console.log(res)).catch(err => console.error(err));
```

### Promisifying

```javascript
// Promisifying an API (Geolocation API)
const getPosition = function () {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    //   position => resolve(position),
    //   err => reject(err)
    // );
    // or
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject);
  });
};
getPosition().then(pos => console.log(pos));
```

### resolve /reject a promise

```javascript
// immediately resolve /reject a promise using thees methods from (promise) object
Promise.resolve('abc').then(x => console.log(x));
Promise.reject(new Error('Problem!')).catch(x => console.error(x)
```

### AJAX Call : `XMLHttpRequest`

**Ajax** is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page. The data is often sent in a format called JavaScript Object Notation `JSON`.

- The ability to load new content into part of a page improves the user experience because the user does not have to wait for an entire page to load if only part of it is being updated. This has led to a rise in so-called **single page web applications** (web-based tools that feel more like software applications, even though they run in the browser).
- Historically, **AJAX** was an acronym for the technologies used in asynchronous requests like this. It stood for **Asynchronous JavaScript And XML**. Since then, technologies have moved on and the term **Ajax** is now used to refer to a group of technologies that offer asynchronous functionality in the browser.
- **Data formats:** Servers typically send back `HTML`, `XML`(which the browser turns into `HTML`), or `JSON`
  - Browsers only let Ajax load `HTML` and `XML` from the **same domain name** as the rest of the page,
    - but `JSON` can be called from any domain **(JSON-P/CORS)**
  - **XML** -> The tags in an `XML` file should describe the data they contain. As a result, even if you have never seen the code to the left. you can see that the data describes information about several events. The `<events>` element contains several individual events. Each individual event is represented in its own `<event>` element.
  - **JSON** :
    - When `JSON` data is sent from a server to a web browser, it is transmitted as a **string**.
    - When it reaches the browser, your script must then convert the string into a JavaScript object. This is known as **deserializing an object**.
      - This is done using the `parse()` method of a built-in object called `JSON`. This is a global object, so you can use it without creating an instance of it first.
    - The JSON object also has a method called `stringify()`, which converts objects into a string using `JSON` notation so it can be sent from the browser back to a server. This is also known as serializing an object.

>To create an Ajax request, browsers use the `XMLHttpRequest` object.
> When the server responds to the browser's request, the same `XMLHttpRequest` object will process the result.

```javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // An instance of the  Object
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`); //  prepares the request
  // 3 parameters --> (methodType, url of the page that will handle the request, A Boolean indicating if if should be asynchronous)
  request.send(); // sends the prepared request to the server
  // we can't do this : const data = request.send();  because the results aren't there yet and we have to wait for it

  // instead we add eventListener on it for when it (loads)
  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    // THEN => use the data object to get what you want in its properties
  });
};
```

### Callback Hell

- it's when we have a lot of nested callbacks in order to execute asynchronous tasks in sequence.
- in fact, this happens for all asynchronous tasks, which are handled by callbacks And not just AJAX calls.

```javascript
// AJAX call country 1
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Egypt`);
request.send();

request.addEventListener('load', function () {
  const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);

  // Get neighbor country (2)
  const [neighbor] = data.borders;

  if (!neighbor) throw new Error('No neighbor found!');

  // AJAX call country 2
  const request2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request2.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/${neighbor}`);
  request2.send();

  request2.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data2 = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    console.log(data2);

    renderCountry(data2, 'neighbor');
  });
});

// another example
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('1 second passed');
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('2 seconds passed');
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('3 second passed');
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('4 second passed');
      }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

## consume promise : (Modern Way)

### Promises / Fetch API

- `Promise` : An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
- or: it's an object that may produce a single value some time in the future, either a resolved-value or a (reason that it's rejected)

  <img src='./img/promise.png' width=48%>
  <img src='./img/promise_state_inspect.png' width=48%>

- **fetch()**: doesn't has Execution context like other functions as it's a facade function (not from JavaScript)
- **fetch()**: returns a **promise object** which has 3 properties:
  ![fetch](./img/fetch.png)
  - `value` --> at first it's empty (`undefined`)
  - `onFulfilled` --> it's an **array** that has the code (functions) that will Javascript run when `value` property   gets filled
  - `onRejection` --> it's an **array** that has the code (functions) that will Javascript run when error occurs
- Benefits of `promises`
  - We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results
  - Instead of nesting callbacks, we can chain promises for a
    sequence of asynchronous operations: escaping `callback-hell`
- _note_ : whatever we `return` from a `promise` will be the `fulfilled` value of that promise (which will be used in the `.then()` method), that's why `arrow-functions` are usually used with promises.
- explanation code :

  ```javascript
  fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Egypt`)
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response); // promise object
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Country not found (${response.status})`);
      return response.json();
      // (.json()) is a method available on all response objects that are coming from (fetch()) function
      // also (.json()) returns a new promise => so we have to return it like we did
    })
    .then(data => {
      // the data we want
      //  do what you want with data object in this function
    });
  ```

- clean code :

  ```javascript
  fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Egypt`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);
    });
  ```

### Handling Rejected Promises (2 ways)

#### handling uncaught error

- this is uaually used to customise the `error message`
  - what we write in `Error()` must be a string, so we use `template literals`

```javascript
// Throwing Errors Manually (as it may not consider it an error if (response) isn't "ok")
if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`error is : (${response.status})`);
```

#### 1. Pass a second callback function in `.then()` method

- this second callback function will be executed when promise is `rejected`

```javascript
fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Egypt`)
  .then(
    response => {
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Country not found (${response.status})`);

      return response.json();
    },
    err => alert(err.message)
  )
  .then(
    data => {
      console.log(data);
    },
    err => alert(err.message)
  );
```

- problem is thet you will have to do it in every `.then()` method which is a pain, instead we use the second way

---

#### 2. using `.catch()` at the end of the promise chain

- the `.catch()` methods catches any `error` that occures anywhere in the `promise-chain`

```javascript
fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Egypt`)
  .then(response => {
    // Throwing Errors Manually
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Country not found (${response.status})`);

    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(`${err} ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥`);
  });
```

---

### `finally` method

- used for something that happens no matter the promise is `fulfilled` or `rejected`

```javascript
// after then & catch
.finally(() => { // any function
       countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
       });
```

---

## consume promise (ES7)

### Consuming Promises with Async/Await

![await](./img/async_await.PNG)

- by using the word `async` before a function, you convert it to an `asyncronous function`
  - which will keep running in the background while performing the code inside of it, than when it's done => it returns a `promise`
  - the word `await` awaits the `result` of the promise (stops code-execution of the function until the promise is fulfilled) and give us the ability to store the fulfilled value in a variable without `then()/callbacks` ðŸ‘Œ
- Inside an async function you can use the `await` keyword before a call to a function that returns a promise. This makes the code wait at that point until the promise is `settled`, at which point the fulfilled value of the promise is treated as a return value, or the rejected value is thrown.
- This enables you to write code that uses asynchronous functions but looks like synchronous code.

```javascript
function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling...');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result); // "resolved"
  // this is the same as
  resolveAfter2Seconds().then(res => console.log(result));
}

asyncCall();
```

- If we try to use `await` **in / without** a `non-async` function, there would be a `syntax error`,so => use `IIFE`

  ```javascript
  (async function () {
    try {
      const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
      console.log(result); // "resolved"
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(`2: ${err.message} ðŸ’¥`);
    }
  })();
  ```

### Error Handling With try...catch

- If a promise resolves normally, then `await promise` returns the result. But in the case of a `rejection`, it throws the error, just as if there were a throw statement at that line.

  ```javascript
  async function f() {
    await Promise.reject(new Error('Whoops!'));
  }

  // â€¦is the same as this:

  async function f() {
    throw new Error('Whoops!');
  }
  ```

- We can catch that error using `try..catch`, the same way as a regular `throw`

  ```javascript
  async function f() {
    try {
      let response = await fetch('/no-user-here');
      let user = await response.json();
    } catch (err) {
      // catches errors both in fetch and response.json
      alert(err);
      console.error(`Error is : ${err.message} ðŸ’¥`);
    }
  }

  f();
  ```

---

## Sequence promises vs Parallel promises

### Sequence promises

- they depend on each other in their order as if one failed, then all fail as well ![Sequence promises](./img/Sequence%20promises.PNG)

  ```javascript
  const get3Countries = async function (c1, c2, c3) {
    try {
      const [data1] = await getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${c1}`);
      const [data2] = await getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${c2}`);
      const [data3] = await getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${c3}`);
      console.log([data1.capital[0], data2.capital[0], data3.capital[0]]);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  };
  get3Countries('portugal', 'canada', 'tanzania');
  ```

---

### Parallel promises methods

#### `Promise.all()`

- takes an iterable (`array`) of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an `array` of the results of the input promises.
- takes an `array` and returns an `array` which you can use array methods like `map()` on it, **but** notice that in `map()` it returns array of `promises and not values`, so we should use `promise.all()` again on this array to get the values
- it `short-circuit` when one promise rejects

```javascript
const loadAll = async function (imgArr) {
  try {
    const imgs = imgArr.map(async img => await createImage(img));
    // now imgs is an array of promises

    // now, we get values from the array of promises
    const imgsEl = await Promise.all(imgs);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};
loadAll(['img/img-1.jpg', 'img/img-2.jpg', 'img/img-3.jpg']);
```

### `Promise.any()`

- takes an iterable of Promise objects. It returns a single promise that resolves as soon as **any of the promises in the iterable fulfills**

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.reject(0);
const promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'quick'));
const promise3 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'slow'));
const promiseArr = [promise1, promise2, promise3];

Promise.any(promiseArr).then(value => console.log(value));
// expected output: "quick"
```

### `Promise.race()`

- returns a promise that **fulfills or rejects** as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(value => {
  console.log(value);
  // Both resolve, but promise2 is faster
});
// expected output: "two"
```

### `Promise.allSettled()`

- returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise.
- It is typically used when you have multiple asynchronous tasks that are not dependent on one another to complete successfully, or you'd always like to know the result of each promise.

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 100, 'foo'));
const promises = [promise1, promise2];

Promise.allSettled(promises).then(results => results.forEach(result => console.log(result.status)));
// expected output:
// "fulfilled"
// "rejected"
```

## Working with data from other servers (Proxy)

**Ajax** works smoothly with data from your own server but - for security reasons - browsers do not load Ajax responses from other domains (known as **cross-domain requests**). There are three common workarounds:

- **PROXY** file on the web server
  - The first way to load data from a remote server is to create a file on your server that collects the data from the remote server (using a server-side language such as `ASP.net`, `PHP`, `NodeJS`, or `Ruby`). The other pages on your site then request the data from the file on your server (which in turn gets it from the remote server). This is called a **proxy**, because it acts on behalf of the other page.
- **JSONP** (JSON with padding)
  - involves adding a `<script>` element into the page, which loads the JSON data from another server. This works because there are no restrictions on the source of script in a `<script>` element.
- **CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (CORS)**
  - involves adding extra information to the **HTTP headers** to let the browser and server know that they should be communicating with each other.
