## Compiled vs Interpreted Language

![compiled](./img/Compiled%20Language.png)

### Compiled Language

- Language is written and compiled to machine code inside of an application
- Errors are detected during compiling
- The code wonâ€™t compile until itâ€™s error-free
- it `optimizes` the code as it **cashes** any repeated function.
  - if it say `add(2,3)` function it caches its result (5) and uses it if it found the same function-call again --> **improves performance**
- Examples: C, C++, Erlang, Go

### Interpreted Language

- Errors found when the code is run
- The interpreter translates and runs code one statement at a time
- Interpreter starts running the code quickly
- Interpreted code runs more slowly
- it's more fit to `javascript` as JS runs on the browser

> Node.js Is an Interpreter

## JavaScript Engine

- javascript uses best of (Interpreted & Compiled) languages ---> **Jit Compiler**

  ![alt](./img/js-engine.PNG)

- is `javascript` an interpreted language ?
  - yes, **initially** but it evolved to use compilers as well based on the implementation

### call-stack & Memory-heap

- Memory-heap: boxes which store datatypes -->error-> `memory leak`:

  - usually when you have values that has place in memory but not used
  - also common in **event listeners** which are always listening(waiting) for an event

- call-stack -->error-> `stack overflow`: usually from **recursion**
  - always the first thing in it is the **global-execution-context**
    ![global-execution-context](./img/global-execution-context.PNG)

---

## Types

- **permatives** & **reference**
  ![pvr](./img/permatives%20vs%20reference.PNG)
  - `value` at a specific `address` (**in the `call stack`**) is immutable ,,, but in the `Heap` its mutable
  - `reference-type` are stored in the `Heap` as we don't know how big its size would be so it's like if the `Heap` has unlimited storage unlike `call stack`
- **Type Coercion** : it's the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another
  ![type coercion](./img/TypeCoercion.png)

  - empty object {} /array [] => true
  - empty string "" => false

  - `+` vs `-` :

    ![type coercion](./img/TypeCoercion2.PNG)

- convert string to number using :
  - `unary` operator (it's a `+` or `-` before the string number) => `console.log(+"565")`
  - `parseint()` or `parsefloat()` => `parseint(100Ahmed)` = 100

---

## Implicit vs Explicit

![implicit Explicit](./img/Implicit-vs-Explicit.jpg)

- **type coercion** is implicit whereas **type conversion** can be either implicit or explicit

---

## Scope

### Lexical scope

(range of functionality) of a variables + Data that it may only be called (referenced) from **within the block of code in which it is defined in**.

- It's where the function was called

- it determines our available variables
- variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration.

![lexical](./img/fig2.png)

## Functional Programming

### currying-vs-partial Application

![currying-vs-partialapplication](./img/currying-vs-partialapplication.jpeg)

- **currying**: one argument at a time
  - It is translating a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each accepting one argument.
- **partial application**: The process of applying a function to some of its arguments. The partially applied function gets returned for later use.

---

### closure

- look at the slides
- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (`enclosed`) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, **a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function**. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
- A closure makes sure that a function doesnâ€™t loose connection to variables that existed at the functionâ€™s birth place

  ```javascript
  let f;
  const g = function () {
    // lexical scope
    const a = 5;
    f = function () {
      // closure
      console.log(a * 2); // (a) is outside :)
    };
  };

  g(); // now a = 5 and f() is defined but not yet called

  f(); // now f() will be called with access to (a) even after g() has bed moved from the call-stack

  console.dir(f); // to access closures variables
  ```

- using callback function which has arguments (Passing "argument" into handler) :

  ```javascript
  // handleHover is a function with 2 parameters(e,opacity)
  // Method 1
  nav.addEventListener("mouseover", function (e) {
    handleHover(e, 0.5);
  });

  // Method 2 (see example for explanation)
  nav.addEventListener("mouseover", handleHover.bind(0.5));
  ```

- when you want to turn **block-scope** into a **functional-scope** -> use **IIFE**

#### Benefits:

- It's usually memory-efficient as it caches the values inside its block-scoped in case that it was called again
- Encapsulation: prevent unwanted access to inner variables/functions

---

### Pure Functions

- **Pure function**: Function without side effects. Does not depend on external variables. Given the same inputs, always returns the same outputs
  - **side-effects**: are about MODIFICATION and not count if we created new item

---

### Referential Transparency

![referential transparency](./img/referential%20transparency.PNG)

---

### composition

In functiona Programming, Composition takes the place of inheritance in OOP.

It is the combination of two functions into one, that when applied, returns the result of the chained functions.

- Composition is a fancy term which means "combining pure functions to build more complicated ones".

```js
let compose = function (fn1, fn2) {
  return fn2(fn1);
};
//or
let compose = (fn1, fn2) => fn2(fn1);
```

---

## JS : The weird parts

- `null` vs `undefined`
  ![null-undefined](./img/null-undefined.png)
- `null` is you set it to empty, `undefined` it's empty because it has not been set.
- or `null` is empty on purpose, while `undefined` is still empty.
- `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value
- `null` is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
- `typeof NaN` = `Number`

### short circuiting => **nullish coalescing operator** `??`

- it's like (or `||`) but works in a different way and can actually return `false value` ![nullish coalescing operator](./img/nullish%20coalescing%20operator.webp)
- **Optional chaining** `?.` :
  ![Optional chaining](./img/Optional%20chaining.webp)
  - is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesnâ€™t exist.
  - enables you to read the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to check that each reference in the chain is valid.
- without `strict mode`, `this` will point to the global object => `window`

---

## notes

- `console` is not built in js, but it's from the `webApi`
- ( \` ) is caled a backticks
- **Statements Vs Expressions** :
  - expression we get a value from it like `5+4` or `Ternary Operator` or `short circuiting` and then you can use it in a `${}`
  - Statements doesn't return a value
- **Strict mode** :
  - It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
  - The purpose of `"use strict"` is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
  - Strict mode changes (previously accepted "bad syntax") into real errors
  - as an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
- `Refactoring the code` : means the process of restructuring code without changing or adding to its external behavior and functionality.
- in `DOM` => `:root` element is called `document.documentElement`
- to make anything `immutable` : `Object.freeze()`

  - it **only** freezes the first level of an object (not a `deep-freeze`)

  ```js
  Object.freeze({
    jonas: 1500,
    matilda: 100,
  });

  Object.freeze([
    { value: 250, description: "Sold old TV ðŸ“º", user: "jonas" },
    { value: -45, description: "Groceries ðŸ¥‘", user: "jonas" },
  ]);

  // or anything because everything is an "object"
  ```
